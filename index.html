            <h2>PLANTS</h2>
            <div class="details">
                <p class="info">Plants are the foundation of life on Earth, producing oxygen through photosynthesis and forming the base of most ecosystems. From towering redwood trees to delicate alpine wildflowers, they come in countless shapes, sizes, and adaptations, each uniquely evolved to thrive in specific environments ranging from arid deserts to tropical rainforests. Beyond their ecological roles, plants sustain human civilization by providing essential resources - they are the primary source of our food supply through crops like wheat, rice, and corn, offer life-saving medicines such as aspirin from willow bark and cancer-fighting compounds from periwinkle, and provide materials for shelter, clothing, and tools. Their influence extends into our cultural and spiritual lives, inspiring art movements like botanical illustration, serving as national symbols (like the cherry blossom in Japan), and featuring prominently in religious traditions and healing practices across indigenous cultures worldwide. Furthermore, plants play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon, regulating water cycles, and maintaining biodiversity that supports entire food webs. Their complex communication systems through root networks and chemical signals continue to reveal astonishing insights about intelligence in the natural world, challenging our understanding of consciousness and interdependence in Earth's biosphere.</p>

            <h2>TYPES OF PLANTS</h2>
            <div class="details">
                <p class="info">The plant kingdom is broadly divided into two groups: flowering (angiosperms) and non-flowering plants (gymnosperms, ferns, mosses). Flowering plants, like roses and sunflowers, reproduce through seeds enclosed in fruits, while non-flowering plants such as pines and ferns rely on spores or exposed seeds. Each type plays a unique role in biodiversity, from supporting pollinators to stabilizing soil.</p>

                    <h3>FLOWERING PLANTS</h3>
                    <div class="type-info">
                        <p>Flowering plants dominate Earthâ€™s landscapes, with over 300,000 known species. Their vibrant blooms attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, ensuring reproduction. Examples include orchids, tulips, and fruit-bearing trees like apple and mango. These plants are vital to agriculture, providing staples like wheat, rice, and vegetables that sustain human populations.</p>

                        <p>Non-flowering plants, though less conspicuous, are equally important. Conifers like pine and spruce form vast forests, while mosses and ferns thrive in damp environments. Some, like ginkgo trees, are "living fossils" unchanged for millions of years. These plants often excel in harsh conditions, from deserts (cacti) to Arctic tundras (lichens).</p>
